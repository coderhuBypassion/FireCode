# Chapter 3: CSS Variable Usage

Welcome back to the FireCode tutorial! In the previous chapter, [Color Theming](02_color_theming_.md), we discovered how FireCode uses **CSS Variables** (like `--bg-color` and `--text-color`) combined with Tailwind CSS to manage color themes easily. We saw how defining these variables under different classes like `.light-theme` and `.dark-theme` allows us to change the application's entire color scheme by simply switching a class on the `<body>` tag.

In this chapter, we'll take a closer look at these CSS variables themselves. What are they, how exactly do they work, and how can you use them directly beyond the predefined color utilities in `tailwind.config.js`? Understanding this gives you even more power to create flexible and maintainable styles.

### What Problem Are We Solving (Revisited)?

We already know CSS variables are great for changing themes globally. But what if you need a specific style rule that isn't covered by a standard Tailwind class, or you want to access a theme color *directly* within your own custom CSS rules?

The problem is: **How can we consistently reference and use our project's defined theme colors (or other style values) in custom CSS rules, ensuring they automatically update when themes change?**

### A Core Use Case: Custom Element Border

Let's consider a specific use case: you have a custom component or element that needs a border. You want this border's color to always match the project's main text color (`var(--text-color)`), regardless of whether the application is in light mode or dark mode. How do you apply this specific border color without hardcoding `#000000` or `#eeeeee`?

You could use the Tailwind utility `border-text` if it existed, but maybe you need more control over the border style than available via standard utilities, or you are writing plain CSS for a very specific purpose.

### Introducing CSS Variables (Custom Properties)

As we touched upon in the previous chapter, CSS variables are a powerful feature of CSS itself. They allow you to define reusable values in your stylesheets. They look like this:

```css
/* Define a variable */
:root {
  --my-custom-color: #ff0000; /* A bright red */
  --spacing-unit: 8px;
}
```

And you use them like this:

```css
/* Use the variable */
.some-element {
  color: var(--my-custom-color); /* The text will be bright red */
  margin-bottom: var(--spacing-unit); /* Adds 8px margin below */
}
```

*   Variable names start with `--` (e.g., `--bg-color`, `--text-color`).
*   You define their value using a colon, just like a standard CSS property (e.g., `--bg-color: #ffffff;`).
*   You use the `var()` function to retrieve the value of a variable (e.g., `var(--bg-color)`).

The key thing is that variables are *inherited*. If you define a variable on an element, that variable (and its value) is available to all that element's children. Defining them on `:root` (which is the `<html>` element) makes them available everywhere in the document.

### Solving Our Use Case: Using `var(--text-color)` for a Border

Let's go back to our use case: making a custom element's border color match `var(--text-color)`.

Based on our understanding of CSS variables and how FireCode defines `--text-color` in its theme CSS (like in [Chapter 2: Color Theming](02_color_theming_.md)), we can simply use `var(--text-color)` directly in our custom CSS rule for that element.

Suppose you have an element with the class `my-bordered-element`. You can add a CSS rule like this:

```css
/* In your custom CSS file (e.g., src/styles/custom.css) */
.my-bordered-element {
  border: 2px solid var(--text-color); /* Use the text color variable */
  padding: 1rem; /* Just some padding */
}
```

Now, whenever the `--text-color` variable changes value (for example, when you switch from light to dark theme by changing the `body` class, as discussed in [Chapter 2: Color Theming](02_color_theming_.md)), the border color of any element with the class `my-bordered-element` will automatically update to the new `--text-color` value.

In your code, you would simply apply this class:

```jsx
// Inside a component file (e.g., src/components/MyCustomBorder.tsx)
function MyCustomBorder() {
  return (
    <div className="my-bordered-element"> {/* Use our custom class */}
      This element has a border matching the current text color.
    </div>
  );
}
```

This element doesn't need any Tailwind color classes for its border because we are handling that specific style with our custom CSS rule that references the variable.

### How It Works Under the Hood (Simplified)

Let's trace what happens when the browser renders our `<div className="my-bordered-element">` and encounters the `border: 2px solid var(--text-color);` rule:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Browser as Web Browser
    participant HTML as Your HTML Structure
    participant ThemeCSS as Theme CSS File (defines variables)
    participant CustomCSS as Your Custom CSS File (defines .my-bordered-element)

    Browser->HTML: Start rendering the <div> with class "my-bordered-element"
    Browser->CustomCSS: Finds the rule for ".my-bordered-element"
    CustomCSS-->Browser: Rule includes "border: 2px solid var(--text-color);"
    Browser->HTML: Element needs value for var(--text-color)
    HTML->HTML: Look up "--text-color" on this element...
    alt Variable not defined locally
        HTML->HTML: ...on parent element...
        HTML-->ThemeCSS: ...up to the root (<html> or element with theme class)
        ThemeCSS-->Browser: Found "--text-color" value (e.g., "#000000" or "#eeeeee")
    end
    Browser->Browser: Use the found value for border color
    Browser->HTML: Render the border with the resolved color
```

1.  The browser renders the element.
2.  It sees the `my-bordered-element` class and looks for matching CSS rules.
3.  It finds the rule `border: 2px solid var(--text-color);`.
4.  To apply the border color, it needs the *value* of `--text-color`.
5.  The browser looks for a definition of `--text-color`, starting on the element itself, then moving up through its parent elements, all the way to the `:root` element.
6.  It finds where `--text-color` is defined (likely in the theme CSS file, associated with `:root`, `.light-theme`, or `.dark-theme`, which is applied to a parent element).
7.  It retrieves the *current* value associated with `--text-color` based on the active theme.
8.  It uses that resolved color value (e.g., `#000000`) to paint the border.

If the theme changes, the value of `--text-color` changes at the `:root` or theme class level. The *next* time the browser needs to determine the border color for `.my-bordered-element`, it will perform the same lookup, find the *new* value, and update the border color.

### Implementation Details

As seen in [Chapter 2: Color Theming](02_color_theming_.md), the core theme variables are typically defined in a central CSS file:

```css
/* Example: styles/theme.css (simplified from Chapter 2) */

/* Default or Light Theme variables */
:root, .light-theme {
  --bg-color: #ffffff; /* White background */
  --text-color: #000000; /* Black text */
  /* ... other light theme colors */
}

/* Dark Theme variables */
.dark-theme {
  --bg-color: #1e1e1e; /* Dark grey background */
  --text-color: #eeeeee; /* Light grey text */
  /* ... other dark theme colors */
}
```
This snippet shows where the `--text-color` variable gets its actual color value depending on whether `.light-theme` or `.dark-theme` (or neither, falling back to `:root`) is active on a parent element.

Then, anywhere else in your CSS, you can use `var(--text-color)`:

```css
/* Example: src/styles/custom.css */
.my-bordered-element {
  border: 2px solid var(--text-color); /* Refers to the variable */
  padding: 1rem;
  margin: 1rem;
}
```
This custom CSS file would need to be imported into your project so the browser loads its rules alongside the theme CSS and the Tailwind-generated CSS.

Remember from [Chapter 1: Frontend Styling](01_frontend_styling_.md) how `tailwind.config.js` links color names like `text` to `var(--text-color)`:

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js (simplified from Chapter 1 & 2)
module.exports = {
    // ...
    theme: {
        extend: {
            colors: {
                // ... other colors
                text: "var(--text-color)", // This links Tailwind's 'text-text' class to the variable
                // ...
            },
        },
    },
    // ...
};
```
This shows that Tailwind's `text-text` utility class itself ultimately uses the `var(--text-color)` function under the hood. When you use `className="text-text"` in your code, Tailwind generates a CSS rule like `.text-text { color: var(--text-color); }`. So whether you use `text-text` or write `color: var(--text-color);` in custom CSS, you are leveraging the same underlying CSS variable system.

### Why This Approach is Powerful

1.  **Consistency:** Ensures specific custom styles still adhere to the project's defined color palette and theme.
2.  **Maintainability:** If the definition of `--text-color` needs to change slightly (even within a single theme), you update it in one place (the theme CSS), and all styles using `var(--text-color)` automatically benefit.
3.  **Flexibility:** Allows you to use theme colors in complex CSS properties or selectors where a simple Tailwind utility might not apply directly.
4.  **Dynamic Styles:** While we focused on theme switching, CSS variables can also be changed dynamically via JavaScript, enabling even more interactive styling possibilities (though theme switching via CSS classes is often preferred for simplicity).

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we solidified our understanding of CSS variables (Custom Properties). We learned that they are native CSS features allowing us to define reusable values like `--text-color`. We saw how these variables are defined in a central place (often grouped by theme) and how we can use the `var()` function to reference their *current* value in any CSS rule, including our own custom ones. This allows us to build styles that are not only consistent with the project's theme but also automatically update when the theme changes, solving our use case of creating a border that always matches the current text color.

By combining the power of Tailwind's utility classes (many of which use variables via `tailwind.config.js`) with the ability to use `var()` directly in custom CSS, FireCode provides a robust and flexible styling system built around a dynamic color palette.

What about other styling concerns beyond colors? How does FireCode handle layout and responsiveness? We'll touch upon that in the next chapter.
